    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Given two nodes, *inherited susceptibility to asthma* and *CCL11* with a single edge between them, *gene_associated_with_condition*, the model is able to predict other possible edges between the two and demonstrates that it is learning meaningful relationships within the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "If you download this notebook and run it yourself, you'll see that the model does not always predict the same thing, so what follows will likely vary for you to some degree. Additionally, it is important to note that the model is not perfect. When running it on just one specific example, it's unrealistic to expect it to get it right everytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, there are some predictions in particular that I find interesting:\n",
    "1. **disease_to_gene_association** is obviously going to be very similar to gene_associated_with_condition, and it looks like the model has made this connection. At the very least, the model should be consistently making simple connections like these.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **literature_co-occurrence** is a strange type and I'm not completely sure how it really works. Sometimes the model will get this correct and sometimes it won't. However, doing some quick searching, it's quite easy to find prior work done concerning CCL11 and inherited susceptibility to asthma. See: https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(05)02508-X/fulltext. It's just not exactly realistic to expect the model to get this predicate correct because of just how unpredictably it behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **contributes_to** again demonstrates that the model is able to find patterns in edge types, and it seems very realistic that if CCL11 is \"likely pathogenic for\" inherited susceptibility to asthma, then CCL11 also contributes to this condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **biomarker_for** is just like contributes_to. If this gene is likely pathgenic for inherited susceptibility to asthma, then it follows that the gene may also be a biomarker for this condition. This reasoning is substantiated in numerous [biomedical papers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24796647/). I've only listed one, but simply searching \"CCL11 biomarker asthma\" should yield more if interested.\n",
